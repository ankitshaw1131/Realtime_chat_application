# Realtime_chat_application
-This is my First Full Stack Project where I have build a Realtime Chat application using *Node Js* and *Socket.io*.

-User can login or signup with email and password.For authentication I have used *JWT(Json Web Token) and bcrypt*.

-User can interact with other user in real time for implementing this I have used Socket.io and there is *typing indicator* also which
will indicate when user is typing.

-There is also a option of *Group Chat* where a user can make group with more than 2 people and interact with everyone in Real time.

-Also,I have added a *notification* at the top which will indicate whenever a new message pops up.

-Tech Stack:- i)React and Chakra Ui for Frontend
              ii)Node Js and Express Js for Backend
              iii)MongoDB for storing Data
              iv)PostMan for Testing the API's.
